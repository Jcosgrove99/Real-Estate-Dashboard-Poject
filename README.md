# Streamlit-RealEstate-Dashboard
Welcome to my first Dashboard using Streamlit! I will detail my journey using Streamlit to build a real estate optimization dashboard. 

This repository will follow my progress as from the beginings of building a streamlit web app and hopefully will end with a web app capiable
to be used by end users. As a side business my best friend and have invested in real estate rental properties in the U.S. and I
this Streamlit web app is going to attempt to provide metrics on investment preformance, show historical trends, provide tools for analyzing 
possible future investments, and hopefully much more! 

Thanks for looking at this repo and am open to adivce and tips on writing better code!
